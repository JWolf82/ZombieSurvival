# ZombieSurvival
This was for a midterm project at RefactorU a coding bootcamp for fullstack JavaScript Development.

This was built on the Phaser frame work at phaser.io.

The game is quite simple in it's first Alpha, click the shoot button and kill the zombies before they get to you.

Future releases:
-better zombie spacing
-more zombies
-different weapons
-finite ammo before reload required
-power ups
